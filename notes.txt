- replaced functions return -2, -1, 1, 2 to represent different endings with an actual enumerator (just improves readability)
- tried to move away from functions returning stuff they dont state.
i.e. play returns whether the game ended or not. its more readable, to just have play() only do the playing.
then have a seaparate function/property to check if game has ended
- move some of the start of the play function to the init function (just feels like it should belong there
- technically hitler is a fascist. so incrememented fascist count in hitler role and changed how it makes roles)
- hitlerState wasnt actually doing anything other than hiding some hitler board attributes kind of behind a secondary class.
